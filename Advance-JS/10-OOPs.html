        // OOPs : - objects orintend programming 
        // major 5 compiller / but use in 4
        // (1) Class and objects :- constructor / Static
        // (2) Encapsulation and Abstraction :- data hide astra / acccess Encapsulation
        // (3) inheritance
        // (4) Polymerphism : - Method overloading and overriding (clint) and (server)


        // (1) Class

        //--> Data member (variable) and member function (function) of class :- blue print of objects


        // (2) Object
        
        //--> An object is an instance of a class, or an independent entity with properties and methods.


        // (3) Encapsulation

        //--> Encapsulation is the concept of restricting direct access to some of an object's properties and methods. This is done to protect the data from being modified externally.


        // (4) Abstraction

        //--> Abstraction involves hiding complex details from the user and exposing only the necessary parts of an objectâ€™s behavior.


        // (5) Polymorphism

        //--> Polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same method in their own way, making it possible to treat different objects through a common interface.


        // (6) Inheritance

        //--> Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This allows for code reuse.
